Loudness processing explained
=============================

Differences in the perceived levels of loudness in audio content between adjacent channels, programs, news, weather and advertisements in radio, video, television and movies has been an ongoing source of consternation for listeners. Loudness processing involves adapting the audio signals from (adjacent) audio sources so that they more closely align in perceived loudness, resulting in smoother transitions between them. The goal of loudness processing is to provide an overall more consistent listening experience for consumers.

Measuring Loudness - ITU-R BS.1770
----------------------------------

Loudness values have historically depended on the electronic measurement of sampled peak levels in audio signals. This form of measurement provided a loophole for "tweaking" audio levels, so that audio producers and sound engineers, working in a commercial environment, found ways to make their audio appear louder than their competitors and thus gain marketing advantage. The outcome was a spectrum of audio content with very inconsistent actual perceived loudness level and wide variations in the quality of content.

This competition for the attention of customers through manipulation of audio levels was coined The Loudness Wars. In an attempt to end The Loudness Wars and to provide a better listening experience for consumers, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) formalized the outcome of research into finding an algorithm to measure perceived loudness in audio: Recommendation ITU-R BS.1770 - Algorithms to measure audio programme loudness and true-peak audio level.

Loudness Standards
------------------

As a result of the wide adoption of ITU-R BS.1770 (now at version 4, 10/2015), standards bodies around the globe have implemented its recommendations and national bodies have made compliance to the relevant standard mandatory in their respective constituencies.

Standards

* EBU R128 (Europe)
* ATSC A/85 (USA)
* ARIB TR-B32 (Japan)
* FreeTV OP-59 (Australia)

Conforming audio to loudness standards
--------------------------------------

Loudness processing involves the use of software algorithms to normalize the average perceived loudness of a program or stream to match a given loudness profile. Matrix ACE provides a set of pre-configured standards-based loudness profiles to easily conform audio to regulatory loudness requirements.

The algorithms conform audio output to a Target Loudness Level using adaptation algorithms that preserve the source audio quality, while normalizing loudness and enhancing spoken dialog.
