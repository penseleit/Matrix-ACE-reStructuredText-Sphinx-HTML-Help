Matrix
------

Matrix is |COMPANY|’s modular, scalable software chassis for flexible transport stream processing. Designed for broadcasters using compressed video for satellite, terrestrial, cable and IP television, Matrix allows operators to flexibly configure our stream processing technologies in the form of modules operating within a consolidated technology platform.

ACE
-------

|COMPANY|’s Matrix Audio Control Engine (Matrix ACE) is software that adjusts audio loudness levels between adjoining video ads and programs and between adjacent playout channels to provide a more uniform listening experience to viewers of television and video.

Adjustment of average perceived loudness
--------------------------------------------

Matrix ACE adjusts audio within MPEG Transport Streams so that it conforms to industry standard *average perceived loudness* levels, enabling satellite, terrestrial, cable, IP and B2B television network customers to meet regulatory requirements in the headend without the need for baseband equipment.

Utilizing |COMPANY|’s advanced transport stream processing engine, together with a powerful loudness processing solution, Matrix ACE conforms audio to the desired loudness profile. Common loudness profiles are built-in (including ATSC A/85, EBU R128, ARIB TR-B32 and FreeTV OP59), or custom settings can be applied as needed.

This marriage of technologies enables Matrix ACE to provide loudness compliance to multiple channels directly within statistically multiplexed transport streams, ensuring that video is passed through unchanged and audio has the desired loudness profile applied without loss in quality.
