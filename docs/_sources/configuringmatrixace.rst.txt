Configuring Matrix ACE
======================

Matrix ACE is configured via its web user interface.

Configuration of Matrix ACE involves navigating to the main user interface landing page - the [Dashboard](Dashboard.html).

From the Dashboard each input is configured to have some or all of its audio elementary streams processed for loudness in a [Loudness Processing Workflow](LoudnessProcessingWorkflow.html).

Within each loudness processing workflow, each applicable audio elementary stream has a `Loudness Profile <LoudnessProfile.html>`_ associated with it.

The loudness profile is used to apply the loudness values configured for that profile to the processing of the audio elementary stream.
